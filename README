This document outlines how to install the stand-alone BATSRUS code
on your system and how to create and access the documentation.  
Note that BATSRUS is part of the SWMF. If you already have the SWMF,
you can use BATSRUS inside the SWMF to build the stand-alone BATSRUS code.

To learn more about the BATSRUS, including how to compile and run the code, 
please consult the user manual.  To install the BATSRUS and create the 
user manual please follow the instructions below. 

##################
# Obtain BATSRUS #
##################

# Get the source code from Git or from the tar balls.

# The minimim requirement is the BATSRUS repository. 

# You may also need the SWMF_data repository that contains large data files
# for BATSRUS in the GM/BATSRUS/data/ and SC/BATSRUS/data subdirectories.
# The other subdirectories can be removed to save disk space.
# The SWMF_data can be put into the home directory or into the BATSRUS directory.

# Some data files used by the Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH)
# are in the CRASH_data repository.
# If needed, it has to be placed into the home directory.

# !!! Getting BATSRUS from Git (requires access to herot) !!!
# Read http://herot.engin.umich.edu/~gtoth/SWMF/doc/Git_instructions.pdf
# about setting up the "herot" ssh alias, passwordless access to herot,
# and defining the "gitclone" alias/function. 

# Check out the BATSRUS distribution
cd {where_you_want_to_have_batsrus}
gitclone BATSRUS

# Check out the SWMF_data distribution into the home directory if needed
cd
gitclone SWMF_data
cd SWMF_data; rm -rf IM PT PW RB SP UA    # if not needed

# Check out the CRASH_data distribution into the home directory if needed
cd
gitclone CRASH_data

# !!! Opening tar balls !!!

# Open BATSRUS tar ball
cd {where_you_want_to_have_batsrus}
tar -xzf {path_to_file}/BATSRUS_v{version_number}.tgz

# If needed, open the SWMF_data tar ball (this contains the BATSRUS data as well)
# into the home directory
cd
tar -xzf {path_to_file}/SWMF_data.tgz
cd SWMF_data; rm -rf IM PT PW RB SP UA    # if not needed

# If needed, open the CRASH_data tar ball into the home directory
cd
tar -xzf {path_to_file}/CRASH_data.tgz

###################
# Install BATSRUS #
###################

# Many machines used by UofM are already recognized by the 
# share/Scripts/Config.pl script which is called by all other 
# Config.pl scripts in the SWMF.
# For these platform/compiler combinations installation is very simple:

Config.pl -install

# On other platforms the Fortan compiler should be explicitly given. 
# To see available choices, type 

Config.pl -compiler

# Then install the code with the selected Fortran compiler, e.g.

Config.pl -install -compiler=ifort

# A non-default C compiler can be added after a comma, e.g.

Config.pl -install -compiler=mpxlf90,mpxlc

# For machines with no MPI library, use

Config.pl -install -nompi -compiler=....

# This will only allow serial execution, of course.

# The ifort compiler (and possibly others too) use the stack for temporary arrays,
# so the stack size should be large. For csh/tcsh add the following to .cshrc:

unlimit stacksize

# For bash/ksh add the following to .bashrc or equivalent initialization file:

ulimit -s unlimited

######################
# Create the manuals #
######################

# Please note that creating the PDF manuals requires 
# that LaTex and ps2pdf be installed on your system.

# To create the PDF manuals type
make PDF

# in the BATSRUS directory. The manuals will be in the Doc/ directory.

# Cleaning the documentation
cd doc/Tex
make clean

# To remove all the created documentation type
cd doc/Tex
make cleanpdf

####################
# Read the manuals #
####################

# All manuals can be accessed by opening the top index file 

open Doc/index.html

# You may also read the PDF files directly with a PDF reader. 
# The most important document is the user manual in

Doc/USERMANUAL.pdf

#################
# Running tests #
#################

# You can try running the standard test suite by typing

make -j test

# in the main directory. The -j flag allows parallel compilation.
# This requires a machine where mpirun is available.
# The tests run on 2 CPU cores by default. 
# Successful passing of the test is indicated by empty *.diff files.

# To run the tests on more (up to 8) cores use

make -j test NP=4

# You can also run an individual test. The list of available SWMF tests
# can be listed with

make test_help

# For example, to run test_shocktube in a serial mode (without MPI)
# but multithreaded with 4 threads (using OpenMP):

make -j test_shocktube MPIRUN= NTHREAD=4
