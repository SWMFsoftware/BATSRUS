# !!! Getting BATSRUS from CVS !!!
# Set the CVS environment variables (with your user name)

setenv CVSROOT Your_User_Name_On_Herot@herot.engin.umich.edu:/FRAMEWORK
setenv CVS_RSH ssh

# Check out the BATSRUS distribution

# Install BATSRUS #
###################

# For several platform/compiler combinations installation is very simple:

Config.pl -install

# Some platforms require additional flags or have other compilers as
# an option. Choose the appropriate platform/compiler combination, e.g.:

Config.pl -install -compiler=g95 -mpi=Intel

######################
# Create the manuals #
######################

# If you opened the tar file, you may have the manuals in the Doc directory.
# Check if you have the user manual in the Doc/ directory
ls Doc/USERMANUAL.pdf

# Otherwise create PDF versions of the manuals in the Doc/ directory.
make PDF

# Create HTML version of the manuals in the Doc/HTML/ directory
make HTML

# Please note that creating both the PDF and HTML versions require that 
# LaTex be installed on your system.  The PDF version requires the ps2pdf
# utility, while the HTML version requires the latex2html utility.
# If you have neither, you can still create a postscript file with 
cd Doc/Tex
make USERMANUAL.ps

####################
# Read the manuals #
####################

# All manuals can be accessed by opening the top index file Doc/index.html
# Use user favorite browser, for example
mozilla Doc/index.html

# You may also read or print out the PDF (PS) files directly with a 
# PDF (PostScript) reader.
